# 🚀 AI Learning Plan for Alpha Phi Alpha Brothers
## Your 4-Week Path to AI Mastery

> *Engineered for you to succeed*

## 📋 Overview

Brothers,

You asked how to learn about AI and how it applies to your businesses and careers. Here's the plan. This is the same framework I built for some of my most successful business mentees—it works because it's built on **action, not theory**.

Perplexity, NotebookLM, and automation aren't just shiny tools. They're **revenue multipliers** 💰 and **career accelerators** 📈 when you know how to leverage them strategically. And you don't need to be a coder. You just need to understand how to think strategically **WITH AI as your team**.
